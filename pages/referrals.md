## How does the referral program work?

The system works in three easy steps:

1. Ask your friend to mention your name during the introductory call

2. Your friend gets $25 off their first purchase

3. You get $25 off your next purchase too!

## What are the terms for the referral program?

The referral program is subject to change/stop without prior notice. $25 discount on the next purchase session per successful referral.

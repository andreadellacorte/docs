## What's your cancellation, "no show" and rescheduling policy?
If you need to cancel a session, please inform us at least before 24 hour. Otherwise, we will consume 50% of a credit.

## Can I get a refund for unused credits?
Yes, no questions asked. We will deduct the payment gateway processing charges from refund amount.
